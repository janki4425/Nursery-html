        In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves.
        In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, e.g., including only woody plants with secondary
        growth, only plants that are usable as lumber, or only plants above a specified height. But wider definitions
        include taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos.

        Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety of plant species that have
        independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The
        majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees
        tend to be long-lived, some trees reaching several thousand years old. Trees evolved around 400 million years
        ago, and it is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees in the world currently.

        <h2>Characteristics of Trees</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Tall and strong plants, usually the largest of all plant types</li>
            <li> Have a thick, woody trunk that supports branches and leaves.</li>
            <li>Branches grow high above the ground, unlike shrubs which branch near the base.

            </li>
            <li>Live for many years – some trees live for hundreds or even thousands of years!</li>
            <li>Usually have deep and widespread roots to support their height and absorb water.</li>
            <li>Produce fruits, flowers, seeds, and leaves depending on the species.</li>
        </ul>
