        A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized perennial woody plant. Unlike herbaceous plants, shrubs have
        persistent woody stems above the ground. Shrubs can be either deciduous or evergreen. They are distinguished
        from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than 6–10 m (20–33 ft) tall.[1][2] Small shrubs,
        less than 2 metres (6.6 feet) tall are sometimes termed as subshrubs. Many botanical groups have species that
        are shrubs, and others that are trees and herbaceous plants instead.

        Some define a shrub as less than 6 m (20 ft) and a tree as over 6 m. Others use 10 m (33 ft) as the cutoff point
        for classification.[2] Many trees do not reach this mature height because of hostile, less than ideal growing
        conditions, and resemble shrub-sized plants. Others in such species have the potential to grow taller in ideal
        conditions. For longevity, most shrubs are classified between perennials and trees. Some only last about five
        years in good conditions. Others, usually larger and more woody, live beyond 70. On average, they die after
        eight years.[3]
