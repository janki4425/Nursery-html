        Creepers are plants with weak stems that grow along the ground. It also grows around another plant, or up a
        wall. It means extending stems or branches. They have very fragile stems that can neither stand erect nor
        support all of its weight or in other words we can say Creeper is the type of plant that grows completely on the
        ground.The stem is completely fragile and it is unable to stand erect and does not support the weight of the
        plant. Small, tiny plants that grow close to the ground are considered to be creepers or creeping plants. They
        are also referred to as procumbent plants.
        Most of the true creepers are smaller plants. It seems to simply crawl "on their bellies" along the ground.
        These usually make good ground covers. They are ground-hugging shrubs. These are valued for their evergreen
        foliage and ability to curb erosion.
        Examples include watermelon, strawberry, pumpkin and sweet potatoes.
